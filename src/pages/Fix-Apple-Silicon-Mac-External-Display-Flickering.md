If you're experiencing screen flickering issues while connected to an external display on your Apple silicon Mac, you're not alone.
Flickering screens and faint lines can be frustrating, but fear not â€“ I've got a solution for you.
In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through the steps to resolve this problem and enjoy a seamless external display experience.

## Step 1: Install the Latest Monitor Firmware

The first step is to ensure your monitor (in my case, it's Dell U3223QE and the firmware version is M3T103) is running the latest firmware.
If its a Dell monitor, head over to the Dell support website and find the latest firmware update for your monitor model.
Download and install it following the provided instructions.

## Step 2: Install Monitor Driver & Color Profiles (If available)

To enhance compatibility and to get custom color profiles from Dell, installing the monitor driver is essential.
Visit the Dell support website once again, locate the appropriate monitor driver, and proceed with the installation.
After the installation is complete, restart your Mac to ensure the changes take effect.

## Step 3: Enable HDR on Both Monitor and Mac

Last step is to fine-tune your display settings, first enable HDR on both your Dell U3223QE monitor and your Apple silicon Mac.
Navigate to your monitor's display settings and enable HDR.
Next, on your Mac, go to System Settings > Displays and enable HDR for the external display.
I'd also recommend disabling True Tone if its a Macbook.

Hopefully this will resolve the annoying flickering! :)
