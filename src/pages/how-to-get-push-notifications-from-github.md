If you‚Äôve got a mobile phone, then you probably know what push notifications are. A [push notification](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-push-notification?ref=techulus.xyz) (also known as a server push notification) is the delivery of information to a computing device from an application server where the request for the transaction is started by the server rather than by an explicit request from the client. Basically, it‚Äôs these bubbles that pop up on your device.

> **We will use Push (**[**push.techulus.com**](https://push.techulus.com/?ref=techulus.xyz)**) as the medium for receiving push notifications.**

In this article, we‚Äôll be discussing how we can get notifications from GitHub as push notifications on our device.

### Let‚Äôs get started

We will setup a real-time push notification workflow using [GitHub actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/send-push-notification?ref=techulus.xyz) (FYI, we could do the same using [Zapier integration](https://zapier.com/platform/public-invite/7743/eacfd29c4087cb67e7798c9876698682/?ref=techulus.xyz) also). Before we start, make sure you‚Äôve setup your account at [push.techulus.com](https://push.techulus.com/?ref=techulus.xyz), installed the app on your device and copied the API key.

Get the API key from Push¬†console.

Now that we have everything ready, let‚Äôs create our workflow on GitHub. We will create a workflow that sends a push notification whenever there is a new issue in our repository.

**Step 1.** Open your GitHub repository page (I will use this repository [https://github.com/arjunkomath/ama](https://github.com/arjunkomath/ama?ref=techulus.xyz)) and go to **Actions** page.

**Step 2.** To create a new workflow click on ‚ÄúNew workflow‚Äù or ‚ÄúSet up a workflow yourself‚Äù button. Now GitHub will draft a new workflow for you with an `echo Hello, world!` command. Let‚Äôs change this and add our custom action.

**Step 3.** Rename the file to `issues_push.yml` and then paste the following into your editor.

```yaml
name: Notify issues

on: issues: types: [opened]

jobs: push:

runs-on: ubuntu-latest

steps: - name: Send Push Notification uses: techulus/push-github-action@v0.0.2 env: API_KEY: ${{ secrets.PUSH_API_KEY }} MESSAGE: "There is a new issue üòÖ"
```

Let‚Äôs go through the lines one by one:

* The first line defines the `name` of this workflow
    
* The second line specify the trigger for this workflow, in our case it is when a new issue is opened
    
* Next we have defined a job `push` that runs on `ubuntu-latest` , the [virtual environment](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners?ref=techulus.xyz) in which our workflow commands will be executed.
    
* Finally, we have the steps for the workflow which is to send the actual notification. We will use [Send Push Notification](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/send-push-notification?ref=techulus.xyz) action that has been published to GitHub marketplace.
    
* Below that we‚Äôve specified our `API_KEY` as a secret and at last the message for our notification. We will see how to create a secret in a moment.
    

Commit this file to master and we have created our workflow! üéâ

**Step 4.** Before testing the notification we have to create a secret to store our `API_KEY` . Open your repository settings and go to secrets tab and then click on **Add a new secret.**

### **Add a new¬†secret**

Enter the name as `PUSH_API_KEY` (we specified this in our workflow using `secrets.PUSH_API_KEY` ) and enter the API key you copied from push console as the value. Click on **Add secret** and we‚Äôre done!

Time to test our workflow, create a new issue in your repository and momentarily you should get the notification on your device.

We can reuse the same action to implement different notifications based on different triggers. You can find more examples on the marketplace page [https://github.com/marketplace/actions/send-push-notification](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/send-push-notification?ref=techulus.xyz).
