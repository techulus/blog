In this article, Iâ€™ll help you set up a free and simple website monitoring tool which sends instant alerts using push notification. Before we begin, letâ€™s have a look a what we will need:

* a website URL to test, obviously
    
* a computer/server to run our bash script
    
* a free account at [push.techulus.com](https://push.techulus.com/?ref=techulus.xyz), we will be using [Push by Techulus](https://push.techulus.com/?ref=techulus.xyz) for delivering real-time push notifications.
    

What is a website monitoring service? Itâ€™s simply a tool that lets us check if our website/server is live or not and also send us instant alerts the moment our website/server goes down. There are many SaaS platform which has several other advanced features, but in this tutorial, we will keep things simple.

Before we start, make sure youâ€™ve set up your account at [push.techulus.com](https://push.techulus.com/?ref=techulus.xyz), installed the app on your device and copied the API key.

Get the API key from PushÂ console

Here is the bash script we will be using. Youâ€™ve to make two changes:

* change the website URL in the script to the one you want to monitor
    
* Update the file with API key from [push.techulus.com](https://push.techulus.com/?ref=techulus.xyz)
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # This script will check to see if a website is up/down by pinging the url
    # your url 
    url="http://blahblahblah.com"
    # your api key from https://push.techulus.com/ 
    push_api_key=""
    # push settings 
    sendNotification(){
     curl -X "POST" "https://push.techulus.com/api/v1/notify/${push_api_key}" \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
      -d "{
     \"title\": \" $1 \",
     \"body\": \" $2 \"
    }"
    }
    # check url 
    wget --server-response --spider --tries=3 $url
    # This wget will only return exit 0 if response is 200 ok
    if [ "$?" -eq 0 ] # so if we have exit status of zero then server is UP
    then
     exit 0
    else
     echo "DOWN | `date`"
     sendNotification "$url is DOWN" "DOWN | `date`"
     exit 0
    fi
    ```
    

All you need to do is, download this script into your machine or server and keep running this script in a regular interval using something like cronjob and weâ€™re done! Thatâ€™s it! ðŸ¥³

The script tries to load our website and if it fails (the server doesnâ€™t respond with status code 200 OK), we assume that something has gone wrong and trigger a push notification.

Make sure you run this script frequently so that we can be alerted on time. To run this script every minute using *cronjob*, we can add the following command to *crontab*. Open crontab using the command

`crontab -e`

and then add the following line:

`/bin/bash /path_to_your_file/script.sh`

Make sure that you add the correct and absolute path to the script file on your machine/server.

Feel free to modify the script, maybe change the message to make it more meaningful or more contextual. Before I wrap this up, huge shoutout to [vbarrier](https://gist.github.com/vbarrier/4d28d71ee8227d8a80cc6c1d57f46702?ref=techulus.xyz). The bash script Iâ€™m using here is a modified version of [his script](https://gist.github.com/vbarrier/4d28d71ee8227d8a80cc6c1d57f46702?ref=techulus.xyz).

Feel free to leave comments in case you have any questions.

Thank you!
